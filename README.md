# OpenStrap
A fork of the "pekora.rip" bootstrapper, edited to be suitable for *any* revivals.



## Compiling
If you'd like, you can compile the bootstrapper yourself.

1. Get the Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs/).
2. On the root of the source, execute `cargo build --release`. The binary will now be located in `target/release/`.
